## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for BCIT COMM 1800 (Group E).

## Why We Develop this Project
Since the students at BCIT get different tasks from different instructors 
everyday, and it is hard for them to keep all things on track. As a result 
they will forget some tasks.

We developed this "HomeWork" project to solve this problem.

## How to Solve the Problem
This project is an Web App. We created all BCIT courses, and the BCIT
students could follow these courses. Once there are new tasks, the 
students could see the tasks.

All tasks will be listed in "Ongoing", "Finished" and "Overdue". The 
students could press the button "Finish" if they have finished a task, 
and the task will be moved to the "Finished" category. If they forget to 
finish the tasks, the tasks will be moved to the "Overdue" category.
